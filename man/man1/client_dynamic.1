.SH SYNOPSIS
.B client-dynamic
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B client-dynamic
program demonstrates how to link against a shared dynamic library
(libmyutils.so).  
The executable is smaller in size compared to the static version, but it depends
on the presence of the shared library at runtime.

The program requires the shared library to be discoverable through either
.BR LD_LIBRARY_PATH
or rpath set in the executable.
